# Summary

  A version of Connect4 written in JavaScript using HTML5 Canvas.

# Explanation

  This is Connect4. Drop a red disc. Have another player drop a yellow. Keep going until one of you has 4 in a row, column, or diagonal.

# Problem

  It's always good to have a grasp of game development. Why? Algebra, Physics, and Geometry, and stop-motion rendering, of course!

# Solution

  This project shows the practical application of several technologies:
  - JavaScript
  - HTML/CSS
  - Heroku
  - GitHub

# Results

  I used my Pong game to create this game.

# Conclusion
  Animation is fascinating.
